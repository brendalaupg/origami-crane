# Letâ€™s Fold an Origami Crane!

This is an xCode playground project that demonstrates the use of Machine Learning to teach users how to fold an origami model.
I choose the crane because it is the most recognizable origami model

## Why Origami?
In my younger days, folding origami was my favorite past time. I dreamt that one day it could go beyond simple diagrams and video tutorials.
